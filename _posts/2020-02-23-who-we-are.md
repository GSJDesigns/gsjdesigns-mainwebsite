# About Us

GSJDesigns was formed by Samantha and myself in 2018. We had both graduated with Honours Degrees from Staffordshire & Keele University. We both have an interest to help companies succeed with the creation of websites and email to ensure companies get the most exposure on the internet.

As we are a family run business we want to offer affordable packages and offer fantastic support.

Glen is a qualified cyber security engineer and with the threat landscape of exploits and vulnerabilities we will ensure the site is as secure as it can be with the last updates applied and using secure methods.
